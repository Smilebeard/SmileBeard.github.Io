# SmileBeard.github.Io
1. Matthew Hall, mrhall5@my.waketech.edu
2. My Github account is my personal github that I use primarly for editing programs with other users created code.
3. This repisitory is my first created repository on github and it was made for a school assignment.
4. To clone my repository to my local machine I hit the + button in the app to clone my repository and then selected all the defaults so it would save to the Github folder in my documents.
